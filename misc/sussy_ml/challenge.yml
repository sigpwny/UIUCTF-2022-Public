  Top scientists in Among Us have finally delivered the impossible; A method to classify the SUS with perfect accuracy.
  To solve amogus once and for all, they needed to suss out the sus *at scale*, and thus created a Neural Network classifier for crewmate images that achieved 100% accuracy over the population, which has a 'sus' rate of less than 5%.

  However, among the `us` lurked a final sus, who destroyed the back half of the fully trained model (where the classification head and some convolutional layers were), and now the sus epidemic looms large again.

  With the partial model left over from the fully trained model, figure out; Who. Is. Sus?

  Flag format is `uiuctf{n1_n2_n3_...}`  
  where `n#` is the numbers that are sus sorted in ascending order. Each image has a number in the filename. For example, if 001.png, 005.png, and 010.png are sus, the flag would be `uiuctf{1_5_10}`
