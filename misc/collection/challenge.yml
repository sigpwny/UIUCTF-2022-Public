hints:
  - These images look awfully familiar. A single pixel has been modified in each of these images, changing the blue value (RGB) to a character in the flag.
  - The coordinate `(x, y)` represents a pixel on the image. All pixels were modified at `(0, y)`, where `y` represents the index of a character on the flag!
  - Create a script that successfully takes all the modified blue values after comparing to the original images on the CTFd, and arrange them based on the `y` value!
