  We fired that engineer. Unfortunately, other engineers refused to touch
  this code, but instead suggested to integrate some ASLR code found online.
  Additionally, we hardened the system with SMM_CODE_CHK_EN and kept DEP on.
  Now that we have the monster combination of ASLR+DEP, we should surely be
  secure, right?
