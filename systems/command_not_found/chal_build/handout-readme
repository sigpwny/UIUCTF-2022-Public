The VM you boot here will not execute the commands that are automatically
sent to bash in a remote session. This means that you have a lot more commands
to play with. However, the get_flag binary is not part of this build.

An FTP server serving on "ftproot" serving port 2121 is not provided.
We use pyftpdlib but the exact implementation should not be relevant.

Due to reasons, the kernel build here requires a minimum of QEMU v6.2.0
