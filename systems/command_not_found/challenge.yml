description: |-
  You went AFK for a few moments and forgot to lock your laptop.
  When you came back you discovered your archnemesis ran the
  unspeakable command. You forgot to take a backup, and you don't
  have a bootable USB lying around. You look through the scrollback
  buffer and notice a copy command is probably still running.
  Maybe, just maybe, you can restore a few files...

  Disclaimer: This story is fictitious; no identification with
  actual persons and places is intended or should be inferred.
  No person or computers were harmed during the production of
  this challenge. Do not attempt running the unspeakable command
  in the real world.

  **If you enter the unspeakable command to the provided VM, triple
  check you have entered into the correct terminal.**

  Note: The flag is not on the hard disk. Carving for the flag will
  not work.
