This directory contains:

- chal_build: The files used to build the challenge.
- run: Pre-built files in case you want to run the challenge locally. This is
  the same copy of the challenge running on the server.

The actual challenge runs a jail utilizing many Linux namespaces for isolation.
The shell you interact with is inside the jail. There's a somewhat convoluted
dance during the namespace setup; the purpose of that is so the shell you
interact with has all capabilities of its userns, which at the same time also
owns the netns of the jail. This is so you are able to send raw packets to the
network interfaces inside the jail.

It might be difficult to debug and see what is happening outside the jail, so
an alternative build "nojail" is offered in addition to the "jail" build. You
can inspect what's going on in other netns via `ip netns exec` command in this
build.

Due to reasons, the pre-built kernel here requires a minimum of QEMU v6.2.0
