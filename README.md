# UIUCTF-2022-Public
UIUCTF 2022 Public Challenge Repository

Notes:
- every challenge folder contains a `challenge.yml` file in the format for [ctfcli](https://github.com/CTFd/ctfcli), CTFd's CLI tool
- `challenge.yaml` files are for deployable challenges, for [kCTF](https://github.com/google/kctf)
- most challenges have a `solution/` folder or `solution.md`
- majority of healthcheck folders contain a full solve script for the challenge (`healthcheck/healthcheck.py`)
